		<p>Murray is an avid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golfer</a> who often plays in celebrity tournaments. His 1999 book <i>Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf</i>, part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> and part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay" title="Essay">essay</a>, expounds on his love of the game. In 2002, he and his brothers starred in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> series, <i>The Sweet Spot</i>, which chronicled their adventures playing golf. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddyshack" title="Caddyshack">Caddyshack</a></i>, one of Murray's earliest film roles, has him playing assistant greens-keeper Carl Spackler who lives in the golf course's tool shed. The title of his book is derived from a scene he played in <i>Caddyshack</i>, narrating his own golf fantasy (which was listed as #92 on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movie_Quotes" title="AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes">AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes</a> list).</p>
		<p>Murray's love for golf is also displayed in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Jam" title="Space Jam">Space Jam</a></i>, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Translation_(film)" title="Lost in Translation (film)">Lost in Translation</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland" title="Zombieland">Zombieland</a></i>.</p>
		<p>On February 13, 2011, Murray, playing with tournament champion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._A._Points" title="D. A. Points">D. A. Points</a>, won the Pro-Am championship at the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Pebble_Beach_National_Pro-Am" title="AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am">AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am</a></i>.</p>
		<h2>Outside of show business</h2>
		<p>He is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant located near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida" title="St. Augustine, Florida">St. Augustine</a>.</p>
		<p>He is a part-owner of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul_Saints" title="St. Paul Saints">St. Paul Saints</a> independent minor-league <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball" title="Baseball">baseball</a> team and occasionally travels to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota" title="Saint Paul, Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a> to watch the team's games. He also owns part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_RiverDogs" title="Charleston RiverDogs">Charleston RiverDogs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley_Renegades" title="Hudson Valley Renegades">Hudson Valley Renegades</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockton_Rox" title="Brockton Rox">Brockton Rox</a>. He invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_Blue_Sox" title="Utica Blue Sox">Utica Blue Sox</a>, Fort Myers Miracle, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Sting" title="Salt Lake Sting">Salt Lake Sting</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Professional_Soccer_League" title="American Professional Soccer League">APSL</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Cougars" title="Catskill Cougars">Catskill Cougars</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City_Trappers" title="Salt Lake City Trappers">Salt Lake City Trappers</a>.</p>
		<p>Being very detached from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood</a> scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts that he had auditioned for and was interested in, such as that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Valiant" title="Eddie Valiant">Eddie Valiant</a> in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit%3F" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit?">Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</a></i>, Sulley in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters,_Inc." title="Monsters, Inc.">Monsters, Inc.</a></i>, Bernard Berkman in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squid_and_the_Whale" title="The Squid and the Whale">The Squid and the Whale</a></i>, Frank Ginsburg in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miss_Sunshine" title="Little Miss Sunshine">Little Miss Sunshine</a></i> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka" title="Willy Wonka">Willy Wonka</a> in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film)" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.</i> When asked about this practice, however, Murray seems content with his inaccessibility, stating, "It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem."</p>
