# Project Library

## About
CSS & JavaScript Library. Use independently within your own project or can be installed automatically by cloning the [Project Wrapper](https://github.com/sdellow/Project-Wrapper) repository instead to create a full framework and workflow.

## Install
You can use this independently in your own project either via cloning this repo and using the `dist` directory. Or simply by using bower and running:

	bower install framework-library

Alternatively, the library will be installed automatically with the Project Wrapper repository available [here] (https://github.com/sdellow/Project-Wrapper).

## Reserved Classes
The Framework does use some generic or 'loose' classes throughout. A lot of these will be filtered out in future releases as they are not specific enough and bad form. However until then this is a list of current classes you should avoid using with new elements:
